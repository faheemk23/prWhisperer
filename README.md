## Summary Report

- ### Approach Taken :
  
  1. Using the medium article given, set up a basic app (using probot) in localhost and then deployed it on Render.
  2. Read the documentation for Github webhook events and figured out which events I had to capture ( like "pull_request.opened", "issue_comment.created").
  3. Read the documentation for various Github apis like to getting the commit messages, files on a pull request, posting a comment etc.
  4. Isolated the final code in the pr files and used the PISTON API to get the output.
  5. Based on the commit messages or comments having the keyword "/execute" conditionally posted a comment with the output. 

- ### Challenges Faced :

  1. **Challenge** : While deploying faced a Error : "SecretOrPrivateKey must be an assymmertric key when using RS256" , **Solution** : Using the error message isolated the error in node modules and figured out that it was because of the Private key not going properly as Environment variable, so created a secret .env file on the deployement and it got resolved.
  2.  **Challenge** : Integrating ESModule ( Piston Node Client ) into commonJS module ( node ), **Solution** : Used dynamic import() syntax.
  3.  **Challenge** : Figuring out what kind of event is trigged when commenting on pull requests ( I thought it would be related pull_request only), **Solution** : Used app.onAny and it's context object's action and payload to figure out it was "issue_create_comment"
  4.  **Challenges** : Code extrated using Diff was giving error in PISTON API as there were extra characters from github like @@ , + , - , **Solution** : created a function to extract only the Javascript code which can be executed by the API.
  5.  **Challenge** : Couldn't use LLM API ( OpenAI ) as they needed paid subscription.
 
 - ###  Suggestions for improvement :

   1. Supporting multiples programming languages instead of just Javascript.
   2. Code explaination in addition to giving output using other code-based LLMs ( Large Language Models ).
